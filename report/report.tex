\begin{abstract}
This paper examines security concerns and potential vulnerabilities in Software Defined Networking (SDN). In particular, we look at the attack vector of remotely introducing a malicious switch into the networking path, something not possible without physical access to the switching site in a traditional network. We also look at the increased risk to the entire network from a single, compromised switch due to the centralized nature of SDN. We implement a rogue switch and execute a generalized denial of service attack on the controller without regard to the controller's applications or interaction mode (reactive or proactive). We then discuss several other attacks possible from a malicious switch and provide some recommendations for hardening SDN controllers and limiting these attacks.

%---- If we're putting this signposting in our intro, I'm not sure we also need it so explicitly here. Kept just in case. First, we provide an overview of SDN, the current status of security in SDN controllers, and discuss the threat models for our attack. We then introduce our rogue switch and present several attacks on various controllers. We also examine additional vulnerabilities to a SDN from a single compromised switch. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for hardening SDN controllers and limiting the area of attack.

\section{Conclusion}
While software defined networking provides many new and exciting avenues for networking innovation, it also introduces new attack vectors. Our results show that a single compromised switch could significantly impair the performance of the controller and, consequently the entire network even if TLS encryption was used to protect the switch-to-controller communication. 

The grand tradition of SDN as a clean-slate networking design \cite{4d} \cite{ethane} \cite{sane} initially included a greater focus on security, particularly of enterprise networks, as one of the main motivations for the new paradigm.  Although this focus has waned in the rush to develop standards, controllers, programming languages, and keep up with industry adoption pressures, we hope that recent work in this area will re-invigorate work in secure SDN design.

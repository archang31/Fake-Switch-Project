\maketitle

\begin{spacing}{1.0}

\begin{abstract}
Here's some space for our abstract, which also is in report.tex ... compile this with make in the report directory.  The makefile runs the latex compiler pdflatex 3 times in order to get the references and citations correct; if it says you have undefined references in the output at the end scroll up in the compiler output to find them!

\section{Introduction}
We probably want to introduce things, right now that's in report.tex.  We might want to cite something in the introduction, we can do that using \begin{verbatim}{\cite{refname}\end{verbatim} where the \emph{refname} is defined in bibliography.tex in the \begin{verbatim}{\bibitem}\end{verbatim} command.  For example citing dpkt looks like this: \cite{dpkt}.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Software Defined Networking}

\subsection{Security in SDN}

\section{Creating a Software Defined Switch}

\subsection{OpenFlow Protocol}

\subsection{Initiating a Connection to a Controller}

\subsection{Push verses Pull Connections}

\label{fake}
I'm making up sections and order... there's a file called fake.tex where we can write about faking a switch. The verbatim environment is useful for preformatted text - there's an example in the introduction!
\input{fake}

\section{Disrupting an SDN with a Fake Switch}
\label{attacks}
There's a file called attacks.tex for describing our various attacks; we could combine the results of the attacks we implemented here, or put them separately.
\input{attacks}

\section{Related Work}
\label{related}
The related work might be long, so let's put it in a separate file, related.tex
\input{related}

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion might be short enough to be in report.tex - we can add other sections before it as necessary, and the bibliography (in bibliography.tex) will follow.

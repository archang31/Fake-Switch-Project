\begin{abstract}
This paper looks at the security concerns and potential vulnerabilities in Software Defined Networking (SDN). In particular, we examine the attack vector of remotely introducing a switch into the networking path, something not possible without physical access to the switching site in a traditional network. We also look at the increased risk to the entire network from a single, compromised switch due to the centralized nature of SDN . First, we provide an overview of SDN, the current status of security in SDN controllers, and discuss the threat models for our attack. We then introduce our roque switch and present several  attacks on various controller. We also discuss additional attacks possible by a rogue switch and examine additional vulnerabilities to a SDN from a single compromised switch. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for hardening SDN controllers and limiting the area of attack.

\section{Conclusion}
While software defined networking provides many new and exciting avenues for networking innovation, it also introduces new attack vectors. Our results show that a single compromised switch could significantly the performance of the controller and, consequently the entire network even if TLS encryption was used to protect the switch-to-controller communication.
